    "Ans. The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python are the same as in any other object-oriented programming language:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: In Python, encapsulation is achieved through the use of private and protected access modifiers. We can define private attributes and methods using a double underscore prefix (__), which makes them inaccessible from outside the class. We can also define protected attributes and methods using a single underscore prefix (_), which signals that they should not be accessed from outside the class unless necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: In Python, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and are used as a base class for other classes. Interfaces, on the other hand, define a set of methods that a class must implement. Both of these concepts allow us to create a simplified model of a complex system and focus only on the relevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: In Python, inheritance is achieved using the same syntax as other object-oriented programming languages. We can create a new class by inheriting from an existing class using the class ChildClass(ParentClass): syntax. The child class will inherit all the attributes and methods of the parent class, allowing us to reuse the code and avoid duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows us to redefine a method in the child class that has already been defined in the parent class. Method overloading, on the other hand, allows us to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class. This allows us to write flexible and extensible code that can handle different types of objects."
